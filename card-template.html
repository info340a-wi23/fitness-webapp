          <h2> Instructions:</h2>
          <p>
            To perform the bench press, grip the bar with your hands, use the ring as a reference for
            where your fingers should be. Drive your back firmly into the bench, then remove the bar from
            the rack. Once holding the bar in a stable position, lower it all the way to your body so it
            rests slighty lower than where your pec muscles insertions begins. Then push the bar off your
            chest until your elbows lock out to perform a rep of the bench press. For strength training
            use heavy weights and perform sets of 1-3 reps. To build muscle volume, use weights that allow
            you to perform 8-12 reps.
