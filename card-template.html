    <p>
      To perform the bench press, grip the bar with your hands, use the ring as a reference for
      where your fingers should be. Drive your back firmly into the bench, then remove the bar from
      the rack. Once holding the bar in a stable position, lower it all the way to your body so it
      rests slighty lower than where your pec muscles insertions begins. Then push the bar off your
      chest until your elbows lock out to perform a rep of the bench press. For strength training
      use heavy weights and perform sets of 1-3 reps. To build muscle volume, use weights that allow
      you to perform 8-12 reps.
