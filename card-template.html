        <h3> Instructions:
        </h3>
        <p>
          To perform the bench press, grip the bar with your hands, use the ring as a reference for
          where your fingers should be. Drive your back firmly into the bench, then remove the bar from
          the rack. Once holding the bar in a stable position, lower it all the way to your body so it
          rests slighty lower than where your pec muscles insertions begins. Then push the bar off your
          chest until your elbows lock out to perform a rep of the bench press. For strength training
          use heavy weights and perform sets of 1-3 reps. To build muscle volume, use weights that allow
          you to perform 8-12 reps.
