    "instructions": "To perform the bench press, grip the bar with your hands, use the ring as a reference for where your fingers should be. Drive your back firmly into the bench, then remove the bar from the rack. Once holding the bar in a stable position, lower it all the way to your body so it rests slighty lower than where your pec muscles insertions begins. Then push the bar off your chest until your elbows lock out to perform a rep of the bench press. For strength training use heavy weights and perform sets of 1-3 reps. To build muscle volume, use weights that allow you to perform 8-12 reps.",
    "comments":
    ["Warm-up properly before lifting heavy weights.",
     "Maintain a proper grip width for each hand.",
     "Keep your shoulder blades squeezed together.",
     "Lower the bar to your mid-chest, not your neck or stomach.",
     "Keep your elbows tucked in close to your body.",
     "Breathe out as you lift and inhale as you lower the bar.",
     "Gradually increase weight to avoid injury.",
     "Focus on form and proper technique over weightlifting."]
