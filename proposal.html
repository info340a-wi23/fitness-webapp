      <h1>Fitness Web App Project Proposal</h1>

    <section class="DataDomain">
      <h2>Provide an overview of the general topic or question of interest
        (e.g., "what is meant by 'homelessness' and why is it a particular problem in Seattle?").</h2>
      <p>
        The topic that we are trying to tackle is fitness by creating an application that tailors a fitness program toward the user's goals.
        So if the user is interested in hypertrophy, we will create a fitness regime based on building muscle. If the user is interested in
        powerlifting, we will create a regime around increasing the user's max numbers. We are creating this application because a lot of people in fitness
        experience paralysis by analysis because there are so many different workout, splits; so, through our application, we are able to solve this for
        the user by focusing on their goals.
      </p>
      <p>Here is one great <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507994/">
        research</a> on influece of fitness app. Here is also another <a href="http://www.nwpc.com/fitness-apps-impacting-exercise-habits/">
        study</a> that shows how fitness apps are impacting our exercise habits</p>
      <p>An information technology problem that a fitness app that provides a workout plan, diet,
        and rest guidance could face is a lack of personalization. Many fitness apps offer generic
        workout plans and diets that may not consider an individual's unique fitness goals,
        physical limitations, or dietary restrictions. Additionally, the app may not be able
        to adjust the workout plan or diet as the user progresses and reaches new fitness milestones.
        This issue could lead to frustration for users who are not seeing the desired results and
        may cause them to stop using the app altogether. Another issue could be the lack of
        integration with other health-related apps and devices, such as heart rate monitors,
        sleep trackers, and nutrition apps, which would provide more comprehensive data and
        personalized recommendations to the user.
      </p>
      <p>One previous or existing attempt to solve the problem of lack of personalization in fitness
        apps is using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The app can adjust the workout plan
        and diet recommendations by using data from the user's activity level, fitness goals, and
        progress. Additionally, by integrating with other health-related apps and devices, the app can gather
        more comprehensive data and provide even more personalized recommendations to the user. Some existing
        fitness apps such as MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, and Endomondo already use this technology to personalize
        workout and diet plans for their users.

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      </header>
      <p>
        A common area of interest in our group is fitness, and we are looking to build a web app
        that contains various different strength training excercises . Our webapp aims to provide
        three functionalities, filter, search, description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app will allow the user to filter the various exercises by the muscle group it targets
        as well as the equipment they have access to. For example, a user might select chest and
        shoulder exercises, and the barbell as equipment they have access to. Our app will then
        recommend exercises such as the bench press and the military press to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another function we wish to provide a information page for each different excercise.
        It will include instructions on how to perform the exercises as well as picture
        demonstrations. It will also include various other information relevant to the exercise
        such as rep range, optimal techniques. We also want to implement a comment section for each
        excercise so users could leave sugguestions and tips for each excercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also wish to implement a search bar for users who simply wish to look up the information
        pages for each exercise as a quick reference on how to perform them.
